# About Me
Hello! I am Ben.
My goals are to be a welder and have a great job in welding
My top career choice is to become a welder because I like working with my hands and creating things. Welding is a good job that can help me earn a steady income and live a comfortable life. It also matches my goal of having a job that is useful and in demand. Skills from this course like teamwork, communication, and project management will help me work better with others and stay organized. These skills will make me more successful in the welding field.
